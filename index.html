    <h2>About Highguard</h2>
    <p>Highguard is a free-to-play FPS from Wildlight Interactive that was released on January 26th 2025. The game is set in a steampunk-fantasy continent known as Highguard; which has just magically re-appeared 
    after millenia of being lost to time. The land is teeming with latent magic that is deadly to the average visitor, so the land is only visited by those known as Wardens, magic-wielding warriors who fight for control 
    over the land's resources and vast knowledge. The game's main mode is called Siege, where two teams of 3 prepare their bases for defense, then ride out for loot. After a short time, a magical sword known as the Shieldbreaker 
    starts to form. After this, both teams must fight for control over the Shieldbreaker, then plant it on the enemy base, summoning a siege tower to break a hole in the base's magical shield and allow the raiding team to attempt 
    to destroy the enemy base. If they are not successful in the first round, the loop repeats until one team is the victor.</p>
